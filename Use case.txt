Process Flow
Order Placement
A sales representative creates a new record in the Re_Plastic_Innovations_Order__c object.

Inventory Monitoring
A flow checks the current stock (Stock_Quantity__c) in the Recycled_Product__c object when an order is placed or when product quantity changes.

Low Stock Automation
If the stock falls below the defined threshold:

A task record is automatically created and assigned to the inventory owner.

A Re_Plastic_Innovations_Restock_Request__c record is created with status set to "Pending".

Request Approval
The request is reviewed and approved either manually or through an Apex trigger or flow.
Upon approval:

The product status is updated.

An email is sent to the warehouse manager with the updated product information.
